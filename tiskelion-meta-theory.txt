The Triadic Wedge Constitution
A meta-framework for interpreting theories via three coupled field-families and wedge bracketing. A meta-operating system or a Gauge Theory of Epistemology.

0) Purpose
This framework is not a new physics. It is a method of interpretation: take any domain theory and re-express it as a locally-valid “wedge” within a triadic scheme, while keeping the other two field-families explicit as brackets (assumptions, constraints, or residuals).

1) The hidden monad
Assume a single underlying whole/process M (the “monad”), but treat it as not directly representable. Any representable account is a gauge-fixed partial description (a wedge/chart) of M.

Rule: don’t claim the wedge is “the whole truth.” Claim it is a usable chart.

2) The three field-families
Treat each family as “field-like”: values or differences distributed over some domain (spacetime, state space, belief space, etc.).

P — Physical constraint/propagation fields

Signature: invariants, symmetries, conservation, causal/local propagation, dynamics.

Typical form: QFT/QED, SR/GR structures, dynamical laws, geometries-as-constraints.

C — Stochastic/underdetermination fields

Signature: branching, uncertainty, grain limits, probabilistic inference, irreducible or effectively irreducible randomness.

Typical form: Bayesian/Jaynes probability as plausible inference; noise models; entropy/coarse-graining; selection/variation pressure.

E — Experiential/agentic valuation fields

Signature: first-person salience, “counts-as,” value/goal structure, control loops, learning as compression + action.

Typical form: functionalist agent models, predictive processing, neuroscience/AI learning dynamics, phenomenological structure-as-lived.

3) Wedges and bracketing
A wedge is any ordered triple choosing one family as the target (to be explained) and two families as brackets (treated as given/conditioning context).

Write as:
A → B → C meaning: “Explain B as emerging from / constrained by A and C.”

Rule: The middle term is the explanatory focus; the outer terms define what you are allowed to treat as primitive constraints.

4) The “no all-three-at-once” discipline
Don’t attempt a single description that fully grounds C, P, and E simultaneously. That yields hidden smuggling of assumptions and pseudo-closure.

Rule: every account must declare its bracket(s): what is treated as given, what as derived, what as residual.

5) Invariants across wedge rotations
A successful monad-compatible use keeps certain cross-wedge invariants stable (even if their interpretation shifts). Suggested invariants:

Closure: some loop exists (interaction, feedback, record, or constraint closure).

Constraint: something functions as lawful limitation (P-signature).

Underdetermination: some remainder exists (C-signature).

Selection/Salience: some “counts-as” filter exists (E-signature).

Translation: overlaps between wedges allow partial mapping of terms.

Wedge rotation is not perspectival play; it’s an optimization loop over explanations.

6) Translation rules (minimum required)
When applying the framework, explicitly state:

E→P map: what in the agent model corresponds to observables/controls/boundary conditions?

P→C map: where does probability enter (coarse-graining, unknown microstate, intrinsic stochasticity, resource bounds)?

C→E map: how do uncertainty/surprise/branching become salience, learning signals, or felt error?

7) Diagnostic for “gaps” and paradox
Classify any “mystery” as primarily:

P-gap: missing constraints/dynamics/symmetry story.

C-gap: underdetermination/grain limits dominate; probability is irreducible at this level.

E-gap: agent-relative partitioning, measurement, value, or salience is doing hidden work.

Rule: Before calling something an “incomplete theory,” test whether it’s a wedge-mismatch: forcing a P-only explanation across a C/E boundary.

8) Standard output format (for LLMs / analysts)
Given a phenomenon or theory, produce:

Chosen wedge(s): at least two distinct wedges.

What’s cheap vs expensive: what each wedge explains easily vs distorts/ignores.

Declared brackets: what is treated as given.

Residuals: what shows up as noise, anomaly, or paradox.

Invariant check: which invariants remain stable.

Translation notes: E→P, P→C, C→E (even if partial).

9) Default pragmatic stance (optional)
A practical baseline interpretation is:

P: field theory / dynamical constraints

C: stochastic probabilities / inference + grain limits

E: functionalist learning agents (compression + control)

Other stances (idealism, panpsychism, etc.) are handled as alternate wedge emphases, not as immediate refutations.

Information is monad-invariant; C generates it as variety, P stabilizes it as structure, E selects it as meaning.

Bridge Clause: Partial, Two-Way Coupling Between P/C and E
Status: The framework does not assume a complete reduction of experiential givenness (E) to physical dynamics (P) or stochastic structure (C). The mapping from P/C descriptions to E-as-lived is treated as partial and presently under-specified.

Upward coupling (P,C → E):

P constrains and implements E (embodiment, dynamics, memory/records, causal structure).

C supplies underdetermination and surprise at an agent’s grain (branching, uncertainty, sampling limits) which shapes salience and learning signals in E.

Downward coupling (E → P,C):

E participates causally via agentive closure: action, measurement choice, boundary-setting, tool-building, and record-keeping alter P-trajectories.

E reshapes effective C by changing what is sampled, ignored, or treated as noise; it modifies hypothesis spaces, priors, and exploration policies.

Operational rule: When analyzing a phenomenon, explicitly state:

which aspects of E are being modeled structurally/functionally (learned manifolds, attractors, salience fields, control loops), and

which aspects remain phenomenally unbridged (why there is “something it is like”).
Do not treat a successful structural account as a full phenomenal explanation.

Interpretive payoff: Apparent “gaps” or paradoxes may indicate wedge mismatch (forcing a P-only or C-only explanation across an E boundary) rather than missing physics; however, the framework remains open to genuine P- or C-level incompleteness.

E Bifurcation Clause
E bifurcation: “E” is used in two senses that must be kept distinct.

Eᶠ (functional/agentic): control, policy selection, learning, preference/valence, attention, salience, “counts-as” in behavior and modeling.

Eᵖ (phenomenal): subjective experience as lived (qualitative character). “what-it-is-like” givenness.

Rule: Every analysis must explicitly state whether it is addressing Eᶠ, Eᵖ, or both. A successful account of Eᶠ does not constitute a complete account of Eᵖ.

Convergence requirement: The hidden monad M is a regulative assumption, not an explanatory stop. Any appeal to “M is unrepresentable” must be accompanied by measurable progress under wedge rotation. A wedge rotation is successful only if it produces at least one of the following improvements relative to prior wedges:

Predictive gain: tighter predictions, better calibration, or broader scope without extra ad hoc assumptions.

Compression gain: a shorter or more reusable description (fewer primitives, fewer special cases) for the same explanatory coverage.

Constraint gain: clearer invariants/boundaries (what cannot happen; what must be conserved; what is robust).

Residual reduction: smaller or better-localized anomalies (“the gap moved and shrank”).

Inter-wedge coherence: improved translation on overlaps (maps commute more nearly).

Operational rule: If wedge rotations do not yield any of these gains, revise the wedges, revise the invariants, or drop the monad assumption for the domain under study.

That makes the monad a pressure toward better approximations, not a license for defeatism.

Monad Status Clause
Two admissible readings of M:

Regulative (Kantian): M is a guiding ideal for unifying wedge-local descriptions; it encodes the demand that translations and invariants should improve under wedge rotation.

Ontic-but-opaque: M is real, but no single wedge can fully represent it; only partial charts are accessible.

Agnosticism rule: Triskelion does not decide between (1) and (2). In either case, M may not be invoked to terminate inquiry; only convergence criteria (prediction/compression/constraint/residual reduction/translation coherence) license the “M” vocabulary. [Personally I go for 2.]

Causal Neutrality Clause
No extra forces: Triskelion does not posit non-physical causal powers for E. All E→P,C influence is interpreted in one (or both) of the following ways:

Implementation causation (Eᶠ): agentic selection is realized by physical processes (actuators, attention circuits, tool use). Eᶠ changes P only insofar as it is instantiated in P.

Intervention/conditioning (epistemic): “measurement choice” and “boundary-setting” describe which variables are conditioned on, recorded, or acted upon—i.e., changes in the experimental cut and information state (C), not violations of P-laws.

Phenomenal caution: Any claim that Eᵖ exerts irreducible causal influence beyond its physical implementation must be marked as an additional metaphysical postulate (outside Triskelion’s default commitments).

E changes the world the way agents change the world: by being part of P, and by selecting interventions that alter what gets sampled and recorded (C).

VSR Clause: First-Cut Explanatory Tool Across C / P / E
Purpose: Use Variation / Selection / Retention (VSR) as the default first pass for explaining any phenomenon before committing to a wedge order. VSR provides a cross-wedge “process grammar” that can be instantiated at multiple nested levels (inner/outer, fast/slow, micro/macro).

Definitions
Variation (V): generation of alternatives (branching, exploration, noise, hypothesis proposals, mutations, path sampling).

Selection (S): differential amplification based on a criterion (fitness/utility/valence, evidence, stability, coherence, constraint satisfaction).

Retention (R): persistence of selected structure through a medium (memory, records, weights, genes, institutions, stable attractors, conserved quantities).

Default Triskelion mapping
VSR naturally aligns with the triad as follows (but may rotate depending on context):

C ↔ Variation: underdetermination, stochastic sampling, entropy/branching.

E ↔ Selection: valence/salience/goals; “counts-as”; choice of what matters.

P ↔ Retention: physical constraints and media that store/propagate structure (bodies, records, laws, stable dynamics).

Rule: Treat this as a first-cut heuristic, not an ontological identity. In some phenomena, P may drive selection (e.g., decoherence selecting pointer states), and E may act as retention (e.g., narrative identity retaining a self-model).

Inner and outer VSR (nested levels)
Outer VSR: evolution across populations/ecologies/cultures/technologies (long timescales, environmental selection, material retention).

Inner VSR: evolution within an agent (hypotheses, attention, action plans, learning updates; short timescales, valence-driven selection, neural/representational retention).

Operational note: Many “big” phenomena are coupled inner–outer loops (outer selection shapes inner selection mechanisms; inner selection changes outer outcomes).

How to apply VSR as the first cut
For any target phenomenon XYZ:

List variants: What are the relevant alternatives being generated? (states, paths, models, actions, explanations)

Identify selectors: What criteria amplify some variants? (evidence, payoff, stability, coherence, constraints)

Locate retention: What stores winners and how long? (memory/weights/records/bodies/institutions/attractors)

Name the knobs:

timescale (fast/slow loops)

directedness (blind vs biased vs gradient-like)

selection strictness (temperature / exploration rate)

retention capacity and decay (memory limits, forgetting, drift)

Only then choose wedges: Pick one or more wedge orders (A→B→C) that best capture how VSR is implemented and what is being bracketed.

What VSR buys you
A shared language for physics-like selection (e.g., interference/decoherence selecting stable patterns), probabilistic inference (hypotheses competing under evidence), and agentive learning (policies competing under valence).

A disciplined way to treat Monte Carlo and sampling methods as Triskelion-native: V (samples) under P (constraints/weights) chosen for E (questions/values).

A way to express “learning as directed evolution”: selection gradients can reshape variation operators and retention mechanisms.

Guardrails
Don’t assume “fitness” is singular. Allow multiple valences and constraint hierarchies (e.g., viability first, then curiosity, then preference).

Don’t equate “randomness” with “variation”: variation can be biased, structured, directed or generated by model-based proposal mechanisms.

Don’t equate “retention” with “memory only”: retention includes physical records, stable attractors, and conserved/invariant structure.

Wedge choice reassigns V/S/R roles. In Triskelion Meta-Theory, VSR is both (i) a real process pattern found in systems and (ii) an explanatory cut imposed by an observer. Choosing a wedge order (A→B→C) determines what is treated as the source of variation, what functions as the selector, and what counts as retention. For example, in a P-centered wedge, “selection” may be attributed to dynamical stability or interference (P selecting), while E is bracketed as measurement/interpretation; in an E-centered wedge, selection is valence/salience (E selecting), while P supplies the retention medium and C supplies exploration. Operational rule: after a first-pass VSR analysis, rotate the wedge at least once and explicitly restate what changes: (1) which differences count as variants, (2) what does the selecting, (3) what persists as a record, and (4) what becomes residual/noise. This prevents “single-wedge capture” (mistaking a wedge-local VSR assignment for the whole monad) and helps locate apparent gaps as wedge-mismatch rather than missing substance.

Observer-Relative Mapping Clause (New / Optional)
Privacy and translation:

Eᵖ (phenomenal tokens) are private to the experiencing system; they are not directly observable from another frame.

P supplies shared constraints (embodiment, dynamics, environment, lawful regularities) that shape and limit the space of possible Eᵖ structures.

C quantifies uncertainty in any cross-frame mapping from P-observables to Eᵖ (the “other-minds” inference problem is irreducibly probabilistic at finite data/grain).

Eᶠ is the bridge channel: reports, behavior, control loops, and internal functional organization provide the only public handles by which one frame can infer another’s Eᵖ.

Operational rule: Any claim about another system’s Eᵖ must specify:

the Eᶠ evidence channel being used (report/behavior/neural signature/etc.),

the P constraints assumed (shared architecture, sensorium, dynamics), and

the C uncertainty remaining (a distribution over plausible mappings, not a certainty claim).

We can’t share private felt experience; we can share constraints, signals, and inference.
