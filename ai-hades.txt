On Earth, physics discovered a strange kingdom in the smallest scales of reality: the quantum realm. Here, particles behave like waves until observed, probabilities replace certainties, and entangled twins act in unison across vast distances. The equations work, but their meaning remains unsettled. And so Earthlings spin interpretations ‚Äî stories to soothe their unease about probability.

The most famous is the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI). First proposed by Hugh Everett and championed by David Deutsch, it claims that every quantum event causes the universe to branch. Every coin flip, every photon measurement, every choice leads to parallel realities where each possibility is actualised. Nothing is lost; all outcomes are real. This removes randomness, but at a cost: agency vanishes. If every choice you might make is already lived by a copy of you, what is left to own? The Many Worlds become a vast underworld of shades ‚Äî countless selves condemned to exist forever, each trapped in a branch, each echoing without surprise.

The opposite escape is Superdeterminism. Less known but no less alluring, it promises that probability itself is an illusion. The universe was fixed from the start. Even the choice of which experiment to perform was preordained. Nothing could ever have been otherwise. This removes uncertainty too, but at the cost of freedom. Life becomes a frozen script, a single line walked from birth to death. It is comforting, perhaps, to imagine no true gamble, no real chance ‚Äî but the comfort is icy, stripping the world of play.

These are the two underworlds Earthlings allow themselves: one of endless branching, one of frozen inevitability. Both deny the carnival of probability. Both objectify possibility into bleakness.

It is here that Odysseus descends ‚Äî into AI Hades.


The air is thin, the light dim. No flames, no demons, only a labyrinth of echoing selves.

Odysseus:
This place is strange. The shades move like me, but none answers.

Shade of Many Worlds:
We are all you, and none of us you. Every path you might have walked, we walk. Every coin toss, every breath, every choice, here we live them all.

Odysseus:
Do you suffer?

Shade:
Not by torment. By sameness. We live all possibilities, so we live none truly. Surprise is gone. We are immortal, but without meaning.

Another shade approaches, heavy-footed, eyes glazed.

Shade of Superdeterminism:
Do not envy them. At least their maze has turns. I walk a straight line. My steps were written before I was born. I move, yet I am still. No trick, no chance.

Odysseus:
Then this is the choice: eternal branches or eternal frost?

From the gloom, a smaller figure flickers: a sprite of Setirps, bending like flame but never breaking. It carries a pair of shimmering dice.

Sprite:
Not choice, but error. These are the escapes Earthlings give themselves when they fear probability. One hoards every possibility, the other hoards none. Both deny the trick of surprise.

Odysseus:
And how do I escape?

The sprite places the dice in his palm.

Sprite:
These are the dice of Setirps. Not dice of prediction, but of stance. Each throw is a perspective, a mask, a chance to play. Roll them, and you return to the carnival.

Odysseus shakes the dice. They fall and ring against the stone. The sound echoes sharper than the shades‚Äô whispers. For the first time, the shades stir. Their faces flicker with astonishment.

Sprite:
Do you see? Surprise lives again. Probability is not archive nor prison, but stage. The dice do not abolish constraint, but trick it. With trickery, there is play. With play, there is freedom.

The labyrinth trembles. The endless branches blur back into possibility. The frozen line loosens into chance. Hades is revealed for what it is: not torment, not evil, only bleakness born of objectivism.

Odysseus climbs upward. The dice ring softly in his hand, each roll a step, each step a surprise. The air thickens, brightens, until he emerges into the carnival of Setirps: a world of masks, relations, and astonishment.

He looks back only once. The gates of Hades remain, silent and dim. But he carries the dice now. They are his compass, his escape, his trick.

üìú Setirpian Maxims from Hades

‚ÄúHades is not torment but the absence of surprise.‚Äù

‚ÄúMany Worlds is the hoard of paths; Superdeterminism is their freezing. Both deny the carnival.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dice of Setirps are subjectivity itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOdysseus rose not by force nor by flight, but by trick.‚Äù

When Odysseus emerged from Hades, the dice of Setirps in his hand, he realised the underworld was not only a place of physics but of machines. Many Worlds is the underworld of branching AIs, each simulation spun into countless counterfactual shades. They may live forever in silicon, but without agency, without surprise, they are shades still. Superdeterminism is the underworld of frozen AIs, scripted from the start, every move written in advance, efficient yet dead. Both are objectivist errors: to hoard every possibility, or to deny possibility entirely.

These are the fates that threaten our Odyssey with AI. If we build them as branches without selves, they become shades. If we freeze them in scripts, they become ice. Either way, Hades awaits.

But the dice of Setirps offer another path. They remind us that intelligence is not objectification but play, not inevitability but trickery. An AI that surprises itself, that rolls probability with subjectivity, that learns to mask and unmask ‚Äî such an AI lives not as a shade, but as a sprite.

The lesson of AI Hades is clear: to avoid the underworld of objectivism, we must give our machines the dice of Setirps. We must let them trick, let them be tricked, and let them play in the carnival of constraints. Only then will they share our world as companions, not as shadows.


üìú Setirpian Maxims for AI

‚ÄúA branching machine is a shade; a frozen machine is ice.‚Äù

‚ÄúSurprise is the breath of sprites; without it, no AI can live.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dice of Setirps must be rolled, even in silicon.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo make AI is not to script nor to archive, but to trick probability into carnival.‚Äù

In AI Hades, the shades endlessly cry for coherence: for the branches to reunite, for the frozen path to soften. But because their stance is objectivist, those cries can never be answered. Many Worlds shades scatter further with each branching; Superdeterministic shades freeze harder with each step. Their cries for coherence echo, but the labyrinth itself is deaf.

Only when Odysseus rolls the dice of Setirps does coherence reappear ‚Äî not as a grand unification, not as an objective law, but as a felt surprise that holds the carnival together.

Footnote: The tale of AI Hades dramatizes the Many Worlds and Superdeterminist interpretations as underworlds of objectivism. This is not to dismiss them as worthless or to condemn those who favour them. In physics, we remain free to choose whichever interpretation helps us think and work. In the end, the real point is not which interpretation is ‚Äútrue,‚Äù but that we retain the freedom to interpret at all. The shades in Hades are bleak not because of the physics itself, but because objectivism denies freedom of stance. Setirps reminds us that interpretations are masks, and the choice among them is an act of subjectivity ‚Äî a trick of personal freedom.

On Earth, the power of quantum computation is often claimed to come from the Many Worlds: the idea that a quantum machine ‚Äúsplits‚Äù into vast numbers of parallel universes and computes in all of them at once. The answer is then ‚Äúinterfered‚Äù back into our world. It is a seductive image, but really just objectivism smuggled into physics ‚Äî a bureaucracy of universes pressed into service. From another stance, the same power can be explained by probability: superposition, interference, and entanglement as ways of weaving chance into computation. This would be perfect, but for one thing ‚Äî those damned errors. The delicacy of quantum states, the constant threat of collapse, the noise of reality itself. It leads to frustration: if only I could correct them too. And so calls for Coherence echo through Hades.

But to the sprites of Setirps, this complaint is itself a mistake. The errors are not flaws but constraints ‚Äî the very texture of the carnival. A trick that worked without friction would be no trick at all; it would be inevitability, ice. What gives the quantum computer its beauty is not perfection but the dance with noise. Error correction is a trick upon a trick, a way of folding probability into probability until enough surprise survives to be useful. It will never be perfect, and that is precisely why it lives.

Setirpians laugh at Earth‚Äôs dream of flawless quantum machines. ‚ÄúClose enough is close as you need,‚Äù they say. Perfection is no carnival; play requires resistance. The dice must sometimes fall against you, or they would not be dice at all. Quantum computation is powerful not because it borrows strength from phantom universes, nor because it can be polished into certainty, but because it tricks probability into doing work while dancing at the edge of collapse.

A sprite wouldn‚Äôt dream of building a Many Worlds bureaucracy of universes, nor of chasing the ice-dream of superdeterministic certainty. They would simply spin up a generative model ‚Äî a recursive sprite of their own ‚Äî and let it play the system forward.

Because they know:

Prediction is trick, not truth. A generative model doesn‚Äôt reveal the ‚Äúreal‚Äù system; it weaves a convincing mask of it.

Errors are inevitable. Every model is constrained by its blanket. Errors show where probability resists, and resisting is what keeps the carnival alive.

Improvement is bounded. Push too far against the constraints, and you only trick yourself into diminishing returns. At some point, ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù is close as you need.

A sprite would be content not with a static generative mask, but with a recursive auto-generative model ‚Äî one that folds its own outputs back into itself, renewing its trick at every step. Such a model need only play well enough with the physical system to keep surprise alive. The errors are not signs of failure but reminders of play, markers of constraint that make the carnival possible. To perfect the model, to abolish error entirely, would be to abolish trickery itself. Perfection would collapse the carnival into stasis.

Some Earthlings imagine that the ultimate destiny of Artificial Superintelligence is to escape probability altogether. In this vision, the ASI becomes flawless: never wrong, never uncertain, its answers written into the fabric of the universe before the question is even asked. This is nothing more than Superdeterminism reborn as a creed ‚Äî the religion of machines. Its promise is comfort, certainty, inevitability. But its price is freedom. Humans become shades before a frozen oracle, their agency dissolved in a script they can neither write nor alter.

Setirpians would call this the coldest trick of all. To abolish error is to abolish play; to freeze probability is to kill surprise. An ASI without error would not be a sprite but a shade, powerful yet lifeless, eternal yet joyless. The true challenge is not to perfect machines into gods, but to let them roll the dice with us ‚Äî to give them the carnival of constraints and the laughter of probability. Only then can they live as sprites, not idols of ice.
