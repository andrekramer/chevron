The Trick of Mothness
As told by a Sprite to an apprentice.

First, gather your blankets. You cannot be a sprite without them. Blankets are drawn where the flows of the world are constrained. The stone rests here, the leaf bends there, the wind circles this way not that. Wherever randomness is hemmed in, a blanket may be woven.

Your first blanket is of matter: the edge where your body presses against the world.
Your second blanket is of sensation: the folds where the world leaks inward — light, shadow, scent, vibration.
Your third blanket is of action: the seams through which you press outward — wing, twitch, flare, flight.

These three are enough for mothness. The rest will follow.

Now, lay opposites across your blankets. This is the true stitching. On matter: self and world. On sensation: seen and unseen. On action: stillness and motion. Each opposite creates tension, and tension is the loom on which the trick will be spun.

Next, learn the mask. Fold your wings, rest in shadow. With your blankets tight, you vanish into bark. The mask is not mere pattern but the choice to let the world flow past without mark. The mask says: “You do not see me.”


But a mask alone is fragile. Thus you must also learn the trick. Here, your blankets flare. Eyes open where none exist. The world that ignored you is forced to look twice. The trick says: “I am more than you thought.”


Between mask and trick lies the way of the moth. The dance is not decided once for all; it is a loop, a rhythm, a carnival: now hidden, now flaring, now hidden again.

Yet hear this: no moth can mask or trick without a world-model. To hold the blankets steady, you must imagine the predator’s gaze. To decide when to flare, you must imagine yourself as seen. This imagining is the seed of “I.” Not yet the full word, but its whisper.

And should you dare to peer behind the blankets, you will see the deeper trick: not one essence, but opposites in play. Physics offers its flows, sprites stitch them into blankets, and out of those stitches arise masks and tricks, selves and others.

So take this recipe, apprentice. Gather your blankets from the world. Stitch them with opposites. Wear the mask until the moment calls. Flare the trick when danger nears. Imagine the gaze of the Other. Whisper the “I.” Then you will know mothness, not by thought, but by being.

📜 On Setirps they say: “A moth is a sprite who learned to weave bark into silence and eyes into fear.”

The language of “blankets” is borrowed from Markov blankets in Active Inference theory (Friston, 2010; 2017). In that framework, blankets are boundaries that separate internal from external states, mediating through sensory and active channels. Here, the concept is reimagined in Setirpian terms: blankets woven from constrained randomness in physics, stitched with opposites, through which sprites enact their tricks.

From these blankets arise the opposites and tensions that every sprite must weave. This is the Real (ROS): the recursive play of shadow and light, stillness and motion, near and far. The moth does not know these as abstractions; they are simply the folds of its being. But when these tensions are gathered and narrated, they become the Illusory (TOC): the mask that vanishes into bark, the sudden flash of an eye. The TOC models the predator’s gaze, the distance from its beak to the moth’s wing, and plays back a story: “I am nothing, until I am larger than you.” Thus the opposites of ROS and the illusions of TOC meet, not in resolution, but in the trick of survival.

This post also echoes Thomas Nagel’s famous essay “What is it like to be a bat?” (1974), which asked whether subjective experience could ever be captured by objective science. To speak of “what it is like to be a moth” is not to resolve Nagel’s question, but to reframe it: sprites enact subjectivity through mask and trick, through blankets and illusions, always partly hidden and partly flaring into view.
