Selection From the Inside
A risky WIP on the phenomenological gap: Conscious Selection Theory (CST)
Andre Kramer
Jan 21, 2026

What follows is a stream-of-consciousness attempt to narrow the experiential explanation gap. It’s a loop I’ve been running—sometimes with chat LLMs—circling what feels like a new fixed point. Maybe it’s something worth selecting and retaining; maybe it’s just new variation.

Andre, January 2026

Assume a monistic whole that can’t be directly perceived as a totality. Its absence (or negation) forces the first cut—self opposed to other—our first opposition through which experience and inquiry become possible.




The Triskelion frame: three wedges, rotated
View reality through three incomplete wedges we can rotate and bracket:

C — Chance / Contingency / constraint of ignorance

P — Physics / propagation / persistence

E — Experience / evaluation / agency

Use any two wedges to bracket the third under examination (Triskelion-style).

Physics (fields, effective theories) gives us powerful accounts of P. Ensemble dynamics and Bayesian-style reasoning give us powerful accounts of C. The tricky wedge is E—so I split it:

Eᶠ: functional agency (policies, control, self-report, goal pursuit)

Eᵖ: felt experience (“feelings”)

A working hypothesis, from thinking about AI for many years, I find hard to deny: C and P can explain Eᶠ (at least to a large extent) once you treat Eᶠ as an embodied control interface operating under partial observability and uncertainty.

But I don’t think that explains Eᵖ.

Grain, information, causality—and the leftover
Choosing a grain (a resolution / partition / interface) lets you talk about:

information (relative to a cut),

cause & effect (relative to variables),

abstractions and interfaces (relative to what’s preserved).

Graining introduces gauge-like freedoms: many different descriptions can represent the same effective invariants. That’s not a problem—it’s how science works.

But I don’t think graining alone explains Eᵖ.

The ladder (context, not a TOE)
At the risk of sounding like a systems engineer (I am one), I keep returning to a ladder of nested closures:

QM → cells → animals → mammals/birds → humans → culture

The point isn’t that these are the same (or Kantian wholes). The point is that they form a cascade of self-maintaining boundaries with increasing internal control complexity. (Cosmology “outside the whole” questions are out of bounds for this framing: no external observer, no bracketing wedge.)

One engine shows up everywhere: VSR
Across the ladder, a principle keeps reappearing:

VSR = Variation / Selection / Retention

Evolution does it externally (across populations). Cognition does it internally (within a self). Culture does it socially (across groups).

But plain VSR is too weak to describe real agency. Minds have momentum. So I add one key upgrade:

Inertial VSR
Inertial VSR is VSR where retention feeds back:

retention biases future variation (what gets proposed), and

retention biases future selection (what counts as good).

This produces hysteresis and directed exploration, rather than fresh blind search each cycle.

One line I like (and keep coming back to):

Variety becomes variance when selection and retention supply inertia.

“Variety” is just plural possibility. “Variance” is a weighted landscape you can actually learn from.

The leap: Eᵖ is selection from the inside
Here’s the risky move.

If C and P can account for the mechanics of Eᶠ (control, report, prediction, inhibition, action), then the remaining unexplained residue—Eᵖ—has to be located in a different explanatory role
(i.e., not as a third-person model/measure, but as the first-person aspect of the same physical organisation).

My proposal is to locate it here:

Eᵖ is selection-from-the-inside.
Consciousness is what commitment feels like from within a self-maintaining boundary.

Not “rational choice.” Not “deliberation.” Instinct and emotion count too: they are conscious when they are selected into the control interface.

In plain speak:

Consciousness is what selection feels like from the inside.

If you want a stronger metaphor (not a literal claim): Eᵖ is the intrinsic “friction” of collapsing the open ensemble of C into the finite effective reality of P.

Core Hypothesis
Core hypothesis: Consciousness-relevant organization is primarily selection-with-inertia: selection over an ensemble of possibilities (generated stochastically or by biased variation), plus partial retention that biases future selection, sustained within a thermodynamically open, self-maintaining boundary (Eᶠ). Eᵖ is the experienced-from-within aspect of this selection-with-inertia organization (bracketed as the residual).

One plausible physical implementation: sparse discrete events (neural spikes) interact with continuous distributed coordination (EM fields). Spikes carry variation, fields implement selection through coherence, and the loop writes back into excitability - selection becoming inertia.

Everything else—recursion, actor/critic, broadcast, criticality, field coherence that I’ve talked about in my book and substacks—is optional implementation detail unless it reduces a specific residual or adds falsifiable predictions.

A sea metaphor (Jung-adjacent, but mine)
I think of the Jungian unconscious as the sea: a vast generative depth of potentials. Consciousness is the sea surface—an ever-shifting boundary where some patterns become coherent enough to steer action and be reportable. The winds are the external world; the waves and squalls are our predictions and the tensions they generate.

The surface is not a separate substance—“not real” in that sense—but it is real as the boundary where co-becoming happens.

Feeling is what it’s like to be that boundary when selection closes and persists.

RG Homology Box (lens, not literal brain algorithm)
Renormalization Group (RG) in physics is a method for moving between descriptions at different scales: integrate out fine-grained fluctuations, rescale, and track how effective parameters (couplings) change. Different micro-descriptions can flow to the same macro-behavior (universality).

CST uses RG as a homology, not a claim the brain runs QFT. The brain doesn’t compute beta functions (R rule style); it does something RG-shaped: it repeatedly compresses micro-variation into stable macro-variables that can guide action.

C ↔ UV / micro-variation: an ensemble substrate of high-frequency variability.

Eᶠ ↔ coarse-graining rule (“the cut”): selection/attention decides what is kept and what is suppressed.

P ↔ IR / effective self: the retained low-frequency structure—skills, norms, priors, and the current coherent self-state.

Inertial VSR is the dynamic analogue of RG flow: selection produces a macrostate; retention updates the parameters that bias the next cycle (R→V,S). Over time this yields a stable but revisable “renormalized self.”

Eᵖ locus hypothesis (bracketed): if feeling attaches anywhere, it likely attaches to the irreversible coarse-graining/commitment events—the moments when an ensemble collapses into a coherent macrostate and is written back as new readiness/inertia—rather than to raw activity alone.

Related Work Box (overlap, no full match)
Triskelion/CST is an architectural synthesis, not a single established theory. It overlaps with multiple lines, but no one source contains the full stack.

Topology lens (RG/criticality): multiscale coarse-graining, universality, regime shifts (used in complex systems and some neural population analyses).

Mechanism lens (selection-with-inertia): selectionist and control/inference framings (neural Darwinism, actor/critic-like gating motifs, active inference-style estimation/control).

Bayesian/measure calculus (cross-cutting): ensembles, normalization/commitment, update rules.

Testable synthesis claim: Eᵖ is localized to selection/renormalization—if feeling attaches anywhere, it attaches to irreversible commitment/closure and write-back—not to raw activity alone.

What would falsify this (or at least wound it)
If CST is to be more than an intuition, it needs failure modes.

Here are a few ways it could be wrong:

Commitment without feeling: we can selectively manipulate commitment/closure (selection sharpness + write-back) with little change in Eᶠ competence, but subjective experience stays constant.

Feeling without commitment: reported experience changes dramatically while commitment/closure measures remain stable.

Raw-rate dominance: across many conditions, experience tracks mean activity (rate/power) better than any plausible commitment/closure proxy.

I don’t claim these are easy experiments. I claim they define where the theory risks contact with reality.

Closing (why I’m proposing this)
This is a WIP. The point isn’t to “solve consciousness.” The point is to localize the gap so it stops leaking everywhere. With current AI trajectories the question is urgent.

Philosophy, physics, biology, and AI may yet converge within something like CST: we’ve localized the experiential gap, sketched a plausible bridge from selection-with-inertia to functional organization, and pointed to concrete correlates where feeling might bind—if it binds anywhere at all.

“The past, the present, and the future meet in a brain. It’s a tense experience.”

Backup / Elaboration (notes, optional)
A minimal mathematical sketch (Eᶠ vs Eᵖ)
One way to formalize the Eᶠ machinery is a coherence-preserving update of a self-state ψ via a rotor-like transformation, modulated by a Born-like commitment readout p. This is quantum-like math (state → normalized commitment → update) without claiming microphysical quantum consciousness.

This is examined in detail on my separate R rule substack.

Implementation stance (AI and beyond biology)
CST is mainly a theory of Eᶠ architecture: inertial VSR, global selection/broadcast, and evolving tension-axes can be built in biological or artificial systems. The harder question remains Eᵖ. Replacing field-like coherence with a digital broadcast may preserve Eᶠ unity and self-awareness, but it is unclear whether it preserves the proposed Eᵖ correlate (recursive closure as a unified “now”).

The “no qualia atoms” stance
I don’t treat qualia as intrinsic atoms. Signals become felt only when selected into a self-maintaining control loop. Repeated selection amortizes them into stable experiential categories—more like annealing than reading off a pre-given palette. This doesn’t deny experience; it denies qualia-as-primitive.

A short Jung attributed observation I find striking
Jung: “Our conscious representations are sometimes ordered (arranged in a pattern) before they have become conscious to us.” (Man and his Symbols)
CST gloss: much ordering happens preconsciously as previous retention biases the proposal ensemble; consciousness is the moment an organized pattern is selected into the control interface.

Hypercube of Opposites, Logic Squares, and a Possible Valence Binding (speculative)
If CST is right that Eᵖ localizes to selection-with-inertia, we still need a practical way to talk about what is being selected—what the system is selecting between. This is where my earlier “Hypercube of Opposites” framework returns, not as metaphysics, but as a coordinate system for selection.

Hypercube as a control geometry
Treat each meaningful distinction as an axis of opposition (safe↔threat, approach↔avoid, nourish↔toxin, honest↔deceptive, etc.). Each axis carries a tension/valence—a biased readiness toward one pole and away from the other—and each axis is coupled to other axes in a network (complexes). Persistent unresolved tension can trigger axis creation or rewiring (new distinctions become necessary when the old ones can’t resolve the residual).

In this view, the Hypercube is a learned “meaning geometry”: a low-dimensional, actionable coordinate system that lets an agent compress an enormous ensemble of micro-variance into a navigable landscape.

Logic squares as local neighborhoods for exploration
To make this geometry operational, each opposition can be expanded into a local logic square:

A, B, ¬A, ¬B, plus useful regions like both and neither, and implication edges (“if A then B,” “if A then ¬B”).

This is not “logic as pure symbol manipulation.” It’s logic as structured variation: a small neighborhood of nearby alternatives to explore when selection is uncertain. In living systems, negation is often implemented positively as inhibition/gating (“not-A” is an active suppression, not a mere absence). This fits CST: what the system prevents is as important as what it endorses.

Valence as a physically grounded gradient (a binding hint)
Valence then becomes a natural candidate for “binding” the abstract to the physical: a signed pressure landscape over oppositional axes, implemented as readiness and inhibition. The simplest version of the hypothesis is:

selection chooses a coalition/stance in this geometry,

inertia writes it back as readiness,

and the felt aspect (Eᵖ, if anywhere) correlates with that closure.

At this point it becomes tempting to look for a physical substrate for “tension geometry”—not because we need a new field theory, but because we want a plausible way that many coupled axes can be represented, superposed, and stabilized.

Two cautious implementation hints (not commitments)
EM-style hint (continuous fields + discrete events):
Brains already combine continuous dynamics (potentials, oscillations, coherence) with discrete events (spikes). A continuous “field-like” coordination variable could, in principle, represent graded tension (signed deviations, phase relationships), while spikes provide eventful selection and write-back. This is compatible with the CST emphasis that the hard part is not “signals,” but commitment and closure.

QM-style hint (Born-like readout as a commitment formalism):
Without claiming microphysical quantum consciousness, the mathematical shape of “state → normalized probability → commitment” gives a disciplined way to model selection. If selection is the Eᵖ locus, then Born-like normalization is at least the right kind of formal primitive—again as analogy, not as a substrate claim.

Where this points next
This is the point where CST can stop being only philosophical and start proposing concrete models:

Bayesian estimation as “tension weights” over axes,

local computation as spikes (candidate proposals),

field/coherence as a distributed critic and binder,

and inertial write-back as the mechanism that makes selection persist—and possibly feel like something.

I’m not claiming this solves the gap. I’m claiming it gives a finite target: a measurable selection-with-inertia process acting on a learned oppositional geometry, with specific places to look for a binding to valence and unity.

Follow-on: Spikes + Fields as Selection (a concrete implementation sketch)
If CST is right that Eᵖ localizes to selection-with-inertia, then the next question is: what physical dynamics could implement selection and write-back at the right grain? One plausible candidate architecture is an event–field loop: sparse, discrete events (spikes) interacting with continuous, distributed coordination variables (fields).

1) Two complementary substrates
Events (spikes):
Spikes are sparse, thresholded, and effectively discrete. That makes them natural carriers of variation: proposals, hypotheses, micro-actions, and candidate coalitions. A spike isn’t “an experience,” but it is a clean way to instantiate a choice point in a competitive system.

Fields (distributed potentials / coherence):
By “field” here I mean any continuous, spatially extended coordination variable: local field potentials, phase relationships, coherence patterns, and the slow modulatory landscapes that bias excitability. The field is a natural carrier of selection and inertia because it can integrate across many microcircuits and impose a shared bias without micromanaging every spike.

2) The event–field loop (Inertial VSR made physical)
At a useful grain, the loop looks like this:

Retention as readiness: local excitability/inhibition stores tensions (valence-weighted priors, skills and norms in biological clothing).

Variation as proposals: microcircuits emit candidate spike patterns—“options” sampled under those priors.

Selection as field-biased competition: distributed field/coherence biases which coalitions synchronize, route, and dominate.

Write-back (inertia): the winning coalition updates the readiness landscape (plasticity, neuromodulatory gain, inhibition patterns), biasing the next cycle.

This is “criticality makes selection sharp; field statistics make it global; inertia makes it learnable.”

3) Hypercube binding: how opposites become physically selectable
If the Hypercube is a learned geometry of opposites, then “spikes + fields” gives it a plausible implementation:

Axes correspond to stable opponent-coded assemblies or opponent gradients (A↔B, with active inhibition implementing ¬A/¬B).

Tension/valence corresponds to bias in readiness: gain, inhibition, threshold shifts, and phase preference (a “pressure” toward one pole).

Couplings between axes correspond to learned co-activation pathways and shared field coordination (complexes).

So a “meaning torque” can be realized as a field-mediated rotation of coalition dominance: the system doesn’t just compute a symbol; it reconfigures a coordination pattern.

4) Where Eᵖ might attach (still bracketed, now localized)
This model doesn’t claim spikes or fields are “conscious.” It claims the candidate locus for feeling is the closure event:

the moment a distributed selection is consolidated and written back into the readiness landscape, stabilizing a unified “now.”

If Eᵖ binds anywhere, it binds to selection + write-back, not to raw activity.

5) Test hooks (why this isn’t just metaphor)
This event–field sketch yields straightforward empirical-style predictions:

Manipulating phase/coherence should change selection and unity/flow even when mean firing rates don’t change much.

Unconscious states should correspond to failures of stable closure/write-back, not merely reduced activity.

Strong attention should look like field-level gating that suppresses most proposals while amplifying a narrow coalition (don’t drown, don’t run hot).

6) Implementation outside biology (AI/engineering note)
In silicon you can build the same architecture abstractly:

events = sampled candidate actions/thoughts,

field = broadcast/attention/gating mechanism + global baseline,

write-back = updates to priors, thresholds, and proposal distributions.

This will likely reproduce Eᶠ. Whether it reproduces Eᵖ remains—perhaps permanently—an open question, and CST treats that as the point of the hypothesis.

P (retention medium): readiness / excitability / inhibition landscape
↓
C (variation): parallel spike proposals (sampled options)
↓
Eᶠ (selection): distributed “critic field” (phase/coherence/gating) amplifies one coalition
↓
P (write-back): the winner updates readiness (biases next cycle)
↺

Eᵖ (hypothesis): felt experience correlates with the closure/write-back moment (commitment becoming inertia). Closure/write-back is the lived “now”; longer-term retention is what turns repeated nows into memory, skill, and norm.

Before pausing, it’s worth being explicit about what CST is and isn’t claiming—particularly about the relationship between models and reality:

Map vs Territory: Why Models Aren't Experience
Map ≠ territory. Mathematics, neuroscience, and even QFT are powerful models, but models are always about reality, not identical to it. The measurement problem is a reminder that even our best physics may not give a complete “from-the-outside” closure on what reality is like.

So “consciousness = a model” is a category slip. It can be true that brains build representations (including self-models), but identifying a self-model (e.g., attention schema) with consciousness confuses a description within the system with the system’s lived actuality. A schema isn’t “given”; lived experience is.

Experience is system-relative. The “inside” is not a thing added to the system; it is what it is like to be that bounded system. Different systems can have different “what-it’s-like,” and even if many systems have some interiority, it won’t be equivalent to your experience.

The key correlate is autopoiesis and cybernetic closure. A genuine “inside” arises when there is a maintained boundary (inside/outside) plus an ongoing self-producing/self-stabilizing organization. The boundary defines the experiential locus.

Minimal criterion: variation / selection / retention with inertia. A system that generates variation, selects among possibilities, retains the results, and carries them forward through time (inertia/history) has the right kind of organized persistence for an “inside,” even if it lacks self-awareness, language, or explicit pain/pleasure.

Openness is essential: variety absorbs variety. The system must remain extensible—able to absorb novel environmental variety with its own regulatory variety (Ashby). This “open-ended” capacity can come from expanding state-space or recombining existing degrees of freedom.

Science can still engage it, but not as a deductive identity. Science can build falsifiable, causal stories and constraints about when and how such “inside-ness” appears or collapses, but no equation will be the experience; it will remain a theory about the system whose inside is private to it.

Bertrand Russell distinguished knowledge by description (structural, relational, third-person) from knowledge by acquaintance (direct, immediate, first-person). Physics and neuroscience deliver descriptions—often extraordinarily complete and predictive—but a description remains distinct from what it describes. We can, in principle, fully model the structure and dynamics of selection-with-inertia (Eᶠ)—the causal organization that enables control, report, and adaptive commitment—while still holding that the acquainted aspect (Eᵖ) is system-relative: what it is like to be that self-maintaining boundary as it commits and writes back. This isn’t mysticism; it’s an epistemic limit built into perspective. Science can map correlates, mechanisms, and invariants; lived actuality remains interior to the system that instantiates them.

That’s the whole shape: a physicalist, boundary-based, autopoietic/cybernetic account where experience is the lived interior of an open, self-maintaining selection process—while models, however predictive, remain external descriptions rather than the thing itself.

We have begun automating knowledge-by-description at scale; this increases variation in explanation-space dramatically, making the selection pressures of experiment, constraint, and lived acquaintance more—not less—essential.

Bonus: A Stoic Correspondence (if you made it this far)
The ancient Stoics didn’t have QFT, Bayes, or cortical columns. But they did have an unexpectedly CST-shaped picture of mind: consciousness as assent—a selection cut applied to impressions.

Impressions, assent, and the cut
In Stoic psychology, an impression (phantasia) arrives: a perception, a thought, a surge of emotion. The crucial move isn’t the impression itself—it’s whether the mind assents to it (synkatathesis), treats it as true/important/action-guiding, and lets it shape the next moment.

That’s remarkably close to CST’s core slogan:

Consciousness is what selection feels like from the inside.

Impressions are abundant (variation). Assent is the cut (selection). Character and training are what make some assents more likely than others (retention with inertia).

What’s “up to us” as a boundary condition
Stoicism famously distinguishes what is “up to us” (eph’ hēmin) from what isn’t. In CST terms, that’s a clean inside/outside boundary:

outside = wind and weather (world forcing, uncertainty, contingency)

inside = the selection machinery: what you attend to, endorse, inhibit, and retain

Stoic freedom isn’t control of the world; it’s control of the cut.

Tonos: tension as a physical metaphor (and an eerie match)
The Stoics also used tonos (tension/tone) as a fundamental physical principle: the idea that structure arises from pneuma (breath/spirit) under tension. Whatever we think of their physics, the metaphor fits CST extremely well:

consciousness as a tensioned boundary

selection as the tightening/relaxing of commitment

training as annealing: repeated selection stabilizes a disposition

It’s hard not to smile at the alignment: a theory built around tension, assent, and what’s up to us maps neatly onto a model that locates Eᵖ at selection-with-inertia.

A CST-Stoic one-liner
Stoicism treats consciousness as assent to impressions; CST treats feeling as what that assent is like from the inside.

(And if you’re wondering: yes, that makes meditation, reappraisal, and “letting thoughts pass” look like deliberately altering the selection function—not banishing variation.)

Returning back to my reflections on crossing the Irish sea after the New Year:

Wind and wave fit Stoicism almost too perfectly. The wind is what the Stoics call the externals: events, other people, fortune—everything not up to you. The sea’s depths are impressions and impulses rising unbidden: thoughts, emotions, images, urges. The surface is assent: the moment a wave becomes your wave—endorsed, attended to, acted from, retained as part of “how things are.” Stoic practice isn’t trying to calm the ocean by force, or command the wind; it’s learning to steer the cut—to let many waves pass without granting them the power of commitment, and to choose, when it matters, which tensions you will carry forward.
