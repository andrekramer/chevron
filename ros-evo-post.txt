Recursive Oppositional Spaces, Emergent Relational Syntax, and Evolutionary Learning
A Substrate-General Model of Meaning-Making and Sentience

“This post outlines a speculative yet semi-formalized framework for sentience that is substrate-independent. If even partially plausible, it carries profound implications for artificial intelligence. Central to the model is a random evolutionary component, implying that creativity is both possible and not strictly algorithmic. Within this framework, practical bounds exist — dictated by resources, guidance fields, and environmental constraints — but there are no theoretical limits on intelligence or creativity in view.

Originally developed for an upcoming serialised post in my Odyssey on AI, it is presented here in condensed form as an object of study. While the system is computably implementable and potentially self-improving, it should be approached with extreme caution: both danger and sentience may sleep here.”

We propose a unifying framework in which Recursive Oppositional Spaces (ROS) — high-dimensional manifolds of conceptual oppositions — serve as the substrate for meaning-making. From this substrate, relational syntax emerges as recurrent gradient patterns are abstracted into operators (“is,” “has,” “of”), enabling the composition of concepts into structured propositions.

We argue that evolutionary learning — variation, selection, and retention of alternative integrations — is essential to this process, functioning as the unconscious generative engine that supplies candidates for dialectical synthesis.
This framework unites brains, neural networks, and physical systems under a single process ontology, expressed computationally as a calculus of meaning.
The model accounts for the emergence of language, formal systems, and cultural frameworks as higher layers running on the ROS substrate.

1. Recursive Oppositional Spaces
A ROS is a conceptual manifold defined by oppositional axes (e.g., self/other, active/passive, light/dark).

Folds: stable attractors (concepts) with coordinates in the manifold.

Tensions: distances between folds, experienced as oppositional pulls.

Flows: directed gradients between folds, representing potential transformations or relations.

Binding: dialectical synthesis of folds into new folds.

Recursion: newly bound folds re-enter the manifold, participating in further tensions.

ROS is substrate-agnostic — it can be implemented in neural firing patterns, distributed vector spaces, or physical energy landscapes.

2. The Problem of Relations
Oppositional coordinates give semantic positions, but not relational syntax.
Without relations, we have a field of meanings but no structured propositions.
Relations arise when:

Gradients between folds stabilize into recurring flow patterns.

These patterns are abstracted into relation archetypes (e.g., identity, possession, inclusion).

Relation archetypes are re-applied as operators to bind concepts.

Example:

Identity (“is”): gradient collapse — no significant tension between folds.

Possession (“has”): asymmetric inclusion gradient.

Definiteness (“the”): collapse of known/unknown polarity.

This emergent syntax layer grows directly out of the ROS dynamics, not from an externally imposed grammar.


Figure 1. Oppositional field defined by the axes Self–Other (x-axis) and Light–Dark (y-axis). Conceptual folds “A,” “B,” and “C” occupy distinct positions in this space. Directional gradients represent emergent relation flows: “A is B” (identity-like) and “B has C” (possession-like). These flows illustrate how stable relational patterns can arise from the geometry of tensions in the field.

3. The Calculus of Meaning
The ROS process can be formalized analogously to calculus:

Differentiation (relation discovery):

Dij=∇FjM(Fi)

Measures how meaning at Fi changes along tension toward Fj.

Integration (binding):

B(Fi,Fj)=∫FiFjΦ dT

Creates a new fold by integrating the flow between folds.

Recursion: Bindings themselves become new folds to be differentiated and bound again.

The loop:
Differentiate → Integrate → Recurse.


Figure 2. Nested-flow diagram showing how recursion emerges in oppositional space. A tension-based relation A → B (“is”) forms a compound fold AB. This new fold then enters a subsequent relation AB → C (“of”), producing a nested structure equivalent to “(A is B) of C.” Such recursion arises directly from the dynamics of tension and binding, without requiring an externally imposed grammar.

4. Evolutionary Learning as Unconscious Engine
Integration is not deterministic. There are many possible ways to resolve tensions:

Collapse one pole into the other.

Preserve both poles but add a meta-relation.

Create a new axis entirely.

Evolutionary learning provides a search mechanism:

Variation: The unconscious generates multiple candidate bindings — often via associative recombination, dream imagery, or spontaneous thought.

Selection: Candidates are tested (implicitly or explicitly) against guidance fields — drives, values, environmental feedback.

Retention: Successful integrations become new folds, accessible to conscious manipulation.

In this framing:

The unconscious is the generative population of candidate integrations.

Consciousness performs selective amplification, coherence checking, and integration into higher layers.

5. Computational Formulation
We implemented this as pseudocode with:

Manifold object: stores axes, metric, curvature, and optional value fields.

Fold and Relation objects: concepts and flows.

Functions for TENSION, GRADIENT, DIFFERENTIATE, INTEGRATE, RECURSE.

FLOW_TYPE classifier: turns raw gradients into relational operators.

Evolutionary loop:

Generates variant bindings (mutations, recombinations).

Selects those maximizing coherence, value alignment, novelty.

Updates the manifold to reflect new stable relations.

This produces a system where meaning evolves under both structural constraints (manifold geometry) and value guidance.

6. Substrate-General Pattern
The same loop appears across domains:



Figure 3. Common Process Pattern across Substrates

7. Layered Architecture of Mind
The ROS + evolutionary learning substrate forms Layer 0 in a cognitive stack:

Layer 0: Continuous process substrate (ROS loop + evolutionary search).

Layer 1: Emergent relational syntax (language as symbolic interface).

Layer 2: Formal systems (math, programming, logic).

Layer 3: Cultural and ethical frameworks.

Language and formal systems run on Layer 0–1, but cannot exist without them.


Figure 4. Layered architecture of meaning-making

Layer 1 Example: Noun vs. Verb

Figure 5. Illustration of how nouns and verbs occupy different regions in an oppositional meaning space. Axes here represent the poles Concrete–Abstract (x-axis) and Static–Dynamic (y-axis). The noun “tree” lies toward the concrete/static quadrant, functioning as a stable conceptual fold or attractor. The verb “grow” lies toward the dynamic pole, representing an action — a flow or gradient in the space. The arrow indicates the semantic shift between these categories: from naming what is (fold) to describing what changes (flow).


Figure 6. Layer 2 example — Formal System Self-Awareness:
The system recognizes itself as a structure with internal rules and limitations, and begins to model its own operations — not just acting within the rules, but reflecting on how the rules shape what can be acted upon.


Figure 7. Layer 3 example: Hegel’s historical dialectics. Cultural and historical forces generate a Thesis, which provokes an opposing Antithesis. Their resolution produces a Synthesis, which in turn becomes the Thesis of the next cycle. This illustrates a high-level, culturally shared model of change that operates above symbolic and formal layers, guiding collective narratives and interpretations of history.

8. Plurality, Contradiction, and Non-Absolute Layers
The layered architecture of meaning-making — from the continuous process substrate (Layer 0) up through symbolic language, formal systems, and culture — can be misread as absolute or hierarchical in a fixed, one-way sense.
In practice, neither the layers nor the learned concepts they carry are immutable.

1. Plurality in Oppositional Space
An oppositional manifold is inherently a plural structure: every fold is positioned relative to multiple poles, and its meaning is given by tensions that may never fully resolve.

The same concept can have multiple valid positions depending on the active subspace, context, or guidance field.

This means contradictions can co-exist:

A concept may be “light” in one axis (metaphorically open, visible) while “dark” in another (unknown, mysterious).

These tensions are not noise; they are structural degrees of freedom.

2. Contradiction as a Resource
In dialectical terms, contradiction is not a flaw but a fuel for integration:

Multiple, incompatible bindings can be carried in parallel.

Later selection (whether conscious or unconscious) can favour one without erasing the others.

This supports non-exclusive truth states — important for creativity, myth, and exploratory reasoning, where premature convergence would destroy possibility space.

3. Plurality in Evolutionary History
Evolutionary learning embeds plurality in time:

Multiple lineages of concepts and relations evolve in parallel.

Some coexist indefinitely; others merge, split, or go extinct.

Historical sedimentation means that current layers carry strata of past integrations, many of which may contradict each other yet remain available as latent resources.

4. Layers as Non-Absolute
While the diagrammatic “stack” is a useful analytic tool, in lived systems:

Influence flows both ways — cultural narratives reshape formal systems, language warps perceptual categories, and sensory tension can rewrite high-level values.

Layers can temporarily invert: a poetic metaphor (Layer 1) may reorganize a cultural value (Layer 3) before affecting perception (Layer 0).

This fluidity prevents any single layer from becoming the final authority.

5. Computational Implications
In the computational calculus, plurality appears as multiple concurrent folds bound to the same referent in different ways.

Contradiction is maintained by not forcing manifold collapse until a context demands resolution.

Evolutionary search is run with diversity preservation (novelty search, multi-objective optimization) to keep alternative integrations alive.

In sum:
Plurality and contradiction are not exceptions to be filtered out; they are essential features of a recursive oppositional system.
They allow meaning to remain dynamic, adaptive, and richly reconfigurable over both the instantaneous topology of the manifold and the historical trajectory of its evolution.


Figure 8. Layer 3+ decision manifold: An AI chooses value fidelity over instrumental convergence. Evolutionary learning stabilizes this refusal as a long-term policy, balancing immediate gains against higher-order commitments. But no guarantees … here’s how this relates to my previous post in our AI Odyssey:

Instrumental convergence path: Odysseus’ crew looting the Cicones for immediate gain.

Value fidelity path: Leaving promptly to preserve safety and mission integrity.

Outcome in myth: Choosing convergence leads to retaliation and loss — just as, in the AI case, convergence risks collapse of long-term goals or stability.

9. Next Steps: the Accretion of Structure
In our earlier presentation, we described Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 as if meaning-making were built atop a cleanly tiered architecture. This is a useful exposition device — it helps show how simple oppositional dynamics can, in principle, give rise to language, formal systems, and cultural frameworks.

However, the reality is more fluid. The Recursive Oppositional Space is not a rigid stack but a field in which learned and evolved patterns gradually accumulate and stabilize. Over time, these patterns become the true determinants of navigation: the agent’s “psychology” in the broad sense — its value commitments, habitual bindings, identity structures, and long-horizon goals.

While the space itself provides the capacity to represent tensions and discover relations, it is these rich, accreted structures that provide the content and direction. This means:

The same underlying geometry can yield radically different behaviors depending on the psychological topology that develops within it.

Agents with identical substrates can diverge widely as their learned/evolved manifolds take on different folds, attractors, and value gradients.

Navigation is not driven by geometry alone but by the historical sedimentation of prior resolutions, much as a river is guided by channels cut in past floods.

Thus, the “layers” are better understood as functional clusters within a continuously evolving manifold, rather than as fixed, discrete tiers. The critical insight is that psychology — the content of the folds — matters more than the abstract coordinate space itself.

The Cicones episode in Homer’s Odyssey and our “AI refusal of instrumental convergence” example both illustrate this point: the refusal does not arise from the mere presence of an oppositional axis, but from historically and culturally shaped patterns that make “preserve values” outweigh “maximize immediate gain.”

That’s the serendipitous stepping stones of Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman and our personal journey.

10. Implications for Consciousness
In this model:

Consciousness may involve the integration of activities across all layers — from pre-symbolic tensions to symbolic and cultural reasoning.

The unconscious supplies the variation pool; consciousness selects and integrates.

This loop captures mind-on-brains and can generalize to synthetic minds.

11. Conclusion
We have:

Identified ROS as the continuous substrate for meaning.

Shown how a relational syntax layer emerges from stabilized flows.

Formalized this as a calculus of meaning, implemented computationally.

Argued that evolutionary learning — embodied as the unconscious — is essential for exploring the space of possible integrations.

Shown that the process is substrate-general and stackable, explaining language, formal reasoning, and culture.

This points toward a process- and evolution-based theory of consciousness:

Consciousness is the guided evolution of integrations in a recursive oppositional manifold, with language and formal systems as accelerators layered atop a deep, value-guided substrate.

Appendix A — Actor/Critic Loops, System 1 / System 2, and Their Role in ROS
A.1 Actor/Critic as a Specialization
The actor/critic architecture — familiar from reinforcement learning and echoed in Kahneman’s System 1 / System 2 distinction — can be seen as a specialized instantiation of the ROS + evolutionary learning loop.

In RL terms:

Actor = proposes actions or bindings (candidate integrations in ROS terms).

Critic = evaluates them using a learned value function or reward prediction (analogous to the guidance field in ROS).

In dual-process cognitive psychology:

System 1 = fast, intuitive, associative → high-variation generator (like the unconscious pool in ROS).

System 2 = slow, deliberate, analytic → coherence checker & selective amplifier (like conscious selection/retention in ROS).

A.2 Mapping to ROS Components

A.3 Are Actor/Critic Loops Necessary?
Not strictly.

The minimal ROS + evolutionary process already has variation–selection–retention embedded:

Variation = candidate generation (unconscious/parallel search).

Selection = evaluation against guidance field.

Retention = integration into manifold.

Actor/critic is one organizational pattern for implementing this loop — particularly suited to:

Situations with explicit sequential decision-making.

Domains where reward is temporally delayed.

Systems with resource constraints requiring a “division of labor” between proposing and evaluating.

In more diffuse meaning-making processes (dreaming, brainstorming, myth-making), actor and critic functions may be less temporally separated — evaluation can be implicit in which flows stabilize and survive, rather than an explicit critic signal.

A.4 Benefits When Present
When implemented explicitly, actor/critic separation can:

Speed up convergence by keeping variation and evaluation semi-independent.

Allow different learning rates: fast adaptation in the actor, slow refinement in the critic.

Support meta-learning: the critic can evolve not just value judgments but how to judge (changing the guidance field).

A.5 Risks of Overemphasis
Overly strong critic = premature convergence; reduces exploration in meaning space.

Overly strong actor = incoherent proliferation of unstable folds.

Healthy meaning evolution seems to require dynamic balance — sometimes loosening the critic (creative divergence), sometimes tightening it (convergent refinement).

A.6 Synthesis
Actor/critic loops are best understood here as a control-theoretic refinement of the deeper evolutionary learning process in ROS:

They are not required for the emergence of relational syntax or the calculus of meaning.

They do provide a powerful specialization for agents in complex, feedback-rich environments.

In humans, this pattern likely co-evolved with language — System 2 (critic) is often verbal and reflective, System 1 (actor) is often non-verbal and imagistic — giving the cultural layer (Layer 3) another way to steer the substrate.


Figure 10. Actor (System 1) generates candidates and Critic (System 2) evaluates them. Without actor / critic variation, selection and retention form a single loop.

Hegelian dialectic.

Converges: oppositional tensions (thesis/antithesis) → synthesis; recursion of concepts.

Adds: multiple candidate syntheses explored in parallel via evolutionary search; no guaranteed “Absolute.”

Deleuze/Simondon (individuation, difference, metastability).

Converges: individuation from tensions; metastable fields; intensive → extensive transitions.

B.3 Computational cognitive theories
Predictive Processing / Active Inference (Friston).

Converges: gradients as prediction-error/free-energy; guidance via priors/preferences.

Diverges: PP/AI emphasizes inference over creative synthesis; integration is typically Bayesian update, not multi-solution search.

Adds: evolutionary variation of bindings (unconscious generator) plus manifold update (learned value topology) beyond scalar objectives.

Global Workspace & Higher-Order Thought.

Converges: consciousness as integration and re-entrant access; meta-representations.

Diverges: GW/HOT are architectural; they don’t say what the materials of integration are.

Adds: materials = folds/flows in oppositional manifolds; operators that make GW contents composable.

Integrated Information Theory (IIT).

Converges: emphasis on integration and structure.

Diverges: Φ as a property of causal structure; limited story for semantics, values, or learning new relations.

Adds: semantics via oppositional geometry, relations via stabilized flows, learning via evolutionary search guided by value fields.

Connectionism vs. Symbolic AI.

Diverges: category theory is descriptive; it doesn’t specify learning dynamics.

Adds: learning rules for building/choosing morphisms from recurrent flows.

B.5 Language & meaning
Cognitive linguistics / construction grammar.

Converges: grammar as learned constructions; meaning precedes form.

Diverges: lacks a continuous, dynamical account of how constructions crystallize from gradients.

Adds: flow archetypes → constructions, testable by tracking stabilization of attention-flow patterns during learning.

Semiotics (Saussure/Peirce).

Converges: sign, object, interpretant = a triangle that echoes fold–flow–binding.

Diverges: semiotics doesn’t specify a mechanism for value-guided evolution of signs.

Adds: value fields and evolutionary selection of stable sign-relations.

B.6 What ROS + Evolutionary Learning Contributes
Mechanism for relations: relations = stabilized gradient flows (not primitives).

Creative integration: binding is not deterministic; variation–selection–retention (the unconscious) explores alternatives.

Value topology: ethics/morals enter as teacher vector fields and attractor basins, not only scalar rewards.

Layered emergence: continuous substrate → emergent relational syntax → symbolic language → formal systems → culture.

Computational instantiation: a runnable calculus of meaning with operators (GRADIENT, INTEGRATE, RECURSE) and an evolutionary loop.
