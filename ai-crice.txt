AI Circe
Odysseus spent a year with Circe. That’s nothing unusual.

I’ve just spent a year with Circe myself — not on an island of enchantments, but wrestling with the question of whether there’s any real difference between a human mind and a hyperscaled language model. I’ve had fun, I’ve learned a lot, but I can’t shake the end-of-an-era feeling. If there is no difference, then we are toast: yesterday’s news, inferior meat machines.

Over the past year, I checkpointed my exploration of that difference in a book project on becoming meaning machines. My proposal is a multidimensional “Hypercube of Opposites”: a space of tensions where semantics, creativity, and culture emerge from the play of oppositions.

And here’s where Circe whispered to me: “It’s all tensors.”


Tensors Everywhere
In physics, a tensor is a way of describing how matter feels when stretched, pulled, or compressed in many directions at once. A stress tensor records not just a single force, but a whole field of tensions.

In machine learning, tensors are just arrays of numbers — but metaphorically, they are still books of tensions. Gradients pull one way, weights push another, backprop sends those stresses rippling backward until the network settles into a new shape.

And in the Hypercube, each axis is an opposition: Chaos/Order, Substance/Process, Self/Other. Cross them and the tensions multiply. It becomes a semantic tensor field, where thought itself is strained and reshaped by opposites.

Aphorism
“A tensor is a book of tensions.
In matter, it records strain;
in machines, it carries gradients;
in thought, it bears opposites.
All learning is a redistribution of stress.”

The Tensor Ratchet
Seen this way, learning — human or machine — unfolds like a ratchet of tensors, each step redistributing tension in a richer form:

Surprise: a raw signal, the shock of the unexpected.

Opposites: binary contrasts (yes/no, self/other) that give structure.

Logic: rules and relations, building stable bridges across opposites.

Probability: weighing uncertainties, balancing tensions statistically.

Analogy: “Ah, it’s like…” — folding novelty into familiar priors.

Inference: mapping possibilities, planning actions, minimizing surprise.

Recursion: beliefs about beliefs, systems that can reshape themselves.

Intelligence: the attractor that emerges from recursive tension-balancing across scales.

From matter to mind to culture, intelligence grows by climbing this ladder — by ratcheting tension into new forms.

Circe tempts me to stay here, because the parallels are beautiful. Stress in physics, gradients in machines, opposites in philosophy — maybe it’s all the same, tensors all the way down.

But I must leave her island. Because even if the analogy runs deep, it does not close the gap. There are still differences that matter: memory, experience, volition, the moral and existential stakes of building artificial minds.


Leaving Circe
So I’ve begun shifting from investigating meaning-making to being a meaning-making machine — using analogy itself as my method, tracing an AI Odyssey. This leads me to a model of cognition as the interplay between a real space (ROS) and illusionary structures (TOC) that emerge from recursive self-modification.

It resonates surprisingly well with Friston’s active inference, with Hofstadter’s strange loops, with Suppes’ probabilist metaphysics. Maybe not so surprising: analogy itself is how the brain lowers surprise. “Ah, it’s like…” is the core act of folding the unfamiliar into the familiar.

Circe says: “It’s all tensors, all trireme decks repeating, no need to leave.” But I follow Odysseus, because there are real tensions between being and becoming still to explore.

The next years will be even stranger than the last. No totalizing answers — just enough to continue our Odyssey in an active way.

Footnote on tensor rank
In mathematics, the rank of a tensor tells you how many “directions” it encodes:

Rank-0: a single number (a scalar).

Rank-1: a list of numbers (a vector).

Rank-2: a grid or table (a matrix).

Rank-3 and up: higher-dimensional arrays, recording relations across many directions at once.

So when the ratchet moves from surprise (rank-0) → opposites (rank-1) → logic/probability (rank-2/3) → analogy (rank-4) → recursion (higher-order), it’s literally a climb up tensor ranks — each step adding more structure for holding and redistributing tension.

And that’s how Circe says: “It’s all tensors.”

Maybe we should have stayed longer as in our next post we descend to AI Hades:
