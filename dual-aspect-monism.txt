A working proposition: Inertial VSR and Dual-Aspect Process Monism
A minimal schema for self, disclosure, and the automation of description by AI

Abstract
This working proposition proposes a minimal process schema—inertial Variation–Selection–Retention (VSR)—as a cross-domain “checkpoint” description for how a coherent world-centered now is continuously achieved in biological minds, and how the production of descriptions of the world is increasingly automated by AI.

The stance is dual-aspect monist: one underlying process can be read under two irreducible aspects. Extrinsically, it is describable as state evolution under constraints; intrinsically, it is lived as disclosure—a unified, temporally thick field of presence (“here–now”) with ownership (“for-me-ness”). The aim is not to explain experience away nor to add “magic dust,” but to supply a compact schema in which selfhood, world-centeredness, and description-as-control can be stated cleanly, and where bridging conjectures can be made empirically risky without promising a reduction of first-person acquaintance to third-person description.

“every Body is a Spirit, and nothing else… the distinction is only modal and gradual, not essential or substantial.” — Anne Conway, The Principles of the most Ancient and Modern Philosophy (1692) “Spirit is Body, and Body Spirit.”

1. Introduction: why a new checkpoint is needed
Modern inquiry tends to privilege explanation over description. Yet in consciousness studies, we encounter a persistent gap: however complete our external descriptions become, the lived fact that “there is a world here, now” remains astonishing. Phenomenology foregrounds this astonishment: experience is not an internal cinema but a world disclosed as present, oriented, and continuous.

At the same time, AI now automates the creation of descriptions—summaries, hypotheses, models, narratives, plans—at a scale and speed that changes culture’s “outer loop.” This pressures our conceptual toolkit. We need a framework that:

treats description as real and operational (not mere commentary),

preserves the irreducibility of lived disclosure (without adding substances),

makes explicit the role of self and inertia in sustaining a continuous “now,” and

allows cautious analogies to other constrained-update formalisms (Bayes, quantum measurement, second order cybernetics, autopoiesis, dialectics) without collapsing them into sameness.

The working proposal here is a minimal schema: inertial VSR, interpreted through dual-aspect process monism.

2. Stance: dual-aspect process monism
We assume one underlying reality, best approached as an ongoing process rather than a static substance. This process admits two irreducible readings:

Extrinsic aspect (outside): publicly describable structure—states, dynamics, constraints, measurements, models. This is the domain of knowledge.

Intrinsic aspect (inside): world-centered disclosure—what it is like to be the process in its ongoing closure: a coherent “here–now” with temporal thickness and ownership. This is the domain of meaning.

This stance differs from:

Substance dualism: no second “mental stuff” is added.

Reductionism that dissolves the inside: the intrinsic aspect is not redefined away as “just a model.”

Epiphenomenal decoration: the inside is not treated as causally irrelevant; rather, causality is a feature of the one process described extrinsically, while disclosure is the same process known intrinsically.

A useful philosophical background point (in the spirit of Bertrand Russell) is that physical theory often gives us structure and relations; it may not exhaust the intrinsic character of what instantiates that structure. But the present proposition does not require agreement with any specific historical formulation; it only requires that “inside” and “outside” are not two things, but two readings of one process.

Breakout: Efficient cause, agency, and why the dual-aspect move is functionally necessary
From the inside of an inertial VSR process, the world is not encountered as a completed causal graph. It is encountered as an open field of possibilities that must be reduced to action-relevant commitments under uncertainty. In that setting, the most effective strategy is often to model parts of the world in agentive terms—i.e., to assign sentience-like sensitivity and goal-directed agency where it improves prediction and control. This is not metaphysical “magic dust,” but a pragmatic claim about efficient cause in the sense of Aristotle: attributing agency can be an efficient causal handle for VSR because it compresses complex dynamics into counterfactual-ready expectations (“if it wants X, it will do Y”), enabling faster and safer selection among actions. On a dual-aspect monist view, this is not merely a convenient fiction: it reflects the fact that the same underlying process admits an intrinsic reading (world-disclosure with lived salience and purpose) and an extrinsic reading (describable dynamics). When we treat other systems as agents, we are not adding a second substance; we are choosing a model class that is often the best available compression for selection—and therefore a real driver of what happens next, because descriptions re-enter and modulate the selection operator itself.

Proposition (Agency as a VSR-optimal model class): In environments containing adaptive systems, modeling certain processes as agents (with goals, sensitivities, and internal selection) is frequently the VSR-optimal strategy for prediction and action, and thus a genuine contributor to efficient causation at the level of situated decision.

This strategy can fail when agency is over-attributed (pareidolia), under-attributed (treating adaptive systems as inert), or misattributed (projecting the wrong goals), leading to systematic selection errors—so its value is empirical and revisable, not a priori guaranteed.

Donald Hoffman argues, via evolutionary game-theoretic models, that natural selection generally optimizes perceptual strategies for fitness payoff rather than for veridical representation of an objective world. In the “fitness-beats-truth” (FBT) results, “truthful” perceptual mappings are often outcompeted by strategies that track only payoff-relevant structure, unless fitness is tightly and monotonically related to truth. Hoffman sometimes expresses this with the provocative slogan that perception approaches “0% veridicality,” meaning not that perception is random, but that selection does not generically reward recovering the full underlying state of reality. This is naturally interpretable within an inertial VSR framework: perceptual experience is a continual sequence of commitments that carve a workable world from a vast possibility space; if evolution tunes the selection functional toward payoff, then the resulting disclosures will be systematically interface-like—useful cuts that hide most underlying structure. Our dual-aspect stance differs from strong skeptical readings of the slogan: even if the extrinsic aspect of perception is a fitness-tuned interface, the intrinsic aspect remains a real mode of disclosure for the organism, and the theoretical task becomes to characterize which forms of closure/retention yield stable world-centered experience under payoff-shaped selection, rather than to infer that “reality is unknowable” tout court.

3. The core schema: inertial VSR
3.1 Why Variation / Selection / Retention?
Across biology and AI (and arguably beyond), systems face large spaces of possibility. Something must reduce open-ended freedom into a committed next state that can guide action and sustain continuity. That generic pattern can be described as:

Variation: generate alternatives.

Selection: weight alternatives under constraints.

Commitment: realize one coherent next step.

Retention: carry forward inertia so the next moment is not created from scratch.

This “predict / choose / commit” rhythm is not unique to cognition; however, adding inertia and selfhood turns it from a generic update loop into a plausible minimal checkpoint for world-centered disclosure.

3.2 Minimal notation (kept deliberately light)
Let:

St​ = retained internal organization at time t (memory/parameters/synapses/ongoing state).

Ct = constraints/context (sensory coupling, task conditions, measurement setting, bodily needs, reward, etc.).

x = a candidate “next commitment” (hypothesis, percept, action policy, state transition, etc.).

(i) Variation
Generate a set (or distribution) of candidates:

Xt∼Π(⋅∣St,Ct).

Meaning: given what the system already is and what is happening, it produces possible next interpretations/actions/states.

(ii) Selection
Score candidates with a selection functional F and normalize:

qt(x)∝F(x;St,Ct).

Meaning: constraints (and internal priorities) weight the candidates; normalization turns weights into a “what wins” distribution.

(iii) Commitment (closure step)
Realize a specific commitment xt\*​ (by sampling or maximizing):

xt\*=κ(qt).

Meaning: underdetermination becomes one coherent “now” that actually governs the next moment. This is the operational heart of world-centering.

(iv) Retention with explicit inertia
Update retained organization with an inertia-controlled blend:

St+1 = (1−λt) St + λt U(St,xt\*,Ct), 0<λt≤1.

Meaning: the system doesn’t fully overwrite itself each moment. The parameter λt is an update rate: small λt​ means strong inertia (stability), large λt means rapid plasticity (adaptation). The function U represents the learning/update operation appropriate to the substrate (synaptic plasticity, gradient update, belief update, etc.).

Why this matters: inertia is what makes continuity possible. Without it, there may be behavior, but not a stable “someone” to whom a world is disclosed.

4. Self: not a “thing,” but a maintained invariant
4.1 Self as the invariant of closure
Introduce a self invariant Σt​ as a functional of the retained organization:

Σt=σ(St).

Meaning: Σt is whatever persists sufficiently to anchor ownership and continuity (identity, boundary conditions, enduring dispositions, stable control parameters).

A minimal stability condition for a sustained self is bounded drift:

d(Σt+1,Σt)≤ε over a regime of operation.

Meaning: the self can change, but not arbitrarily; it must remain coherent across time.

4.2 Intrinsic self vs extrinsic self-model
This schema separates two notions often conflated:

Intrinsic self (inside): the lived continuity of closure—commitment and retention as experienced from within, yielding “for-me-ness.”

Self-model (outside): an object of knowledge about the system—narratives, body schema, explicit beliefs about identity, profiles in software systems, etc.

This is where “the intrinsic nature binds to the inside; the descriptive aspect binds to the outside as knowledge” becomes precise: the self-model is part of the extrinsic aspect, while the intrinsic self is the continuity of closure in the intrinsic aspect.

This separation is compatible with, but not identical to, the “self-model” emphasis of Thomas Metzinger: the present proposal treats models as important controls but refuses to identify “having a model” with “having an inside.”

5. Disclosure and description: how we can “experience descriptions”
Phenomenology’s key observation is that experience is not an inner screen but a world disclosed as a unified field. Borrowing that term, disclosure names the intrinsic aspect: world-showing.

The modern twist is that descriptions increasingly re-enter the loop and shape selection. Let:

Dt​ = a description (concept, narrative, theory, linguistic compression, AI-produced summary),

which can modulate selection and learning:

F←F(⋅;Dt), U←U(⋅;Dt), λt←λt(Dt).

Meaning: descriptions are not merely reports. They can function as control surfaces that change what is salient, what is plausible, what counts as evidence, how strongly we update, and which possibilities we even generate next. In lived terms, the world we inhabit becomes concept-laden not because concepts float over experience as labels, but because they reshape the selection dynamics that continuously re-close the present.

This gives a non-magical reading of “we experience the descriptions.” We do not mean descriptions cause experience. We mean: descriptions enter the dynamics that constitute disclosure, and therefore appear within what is disclosed.

This also clarifies AI’s role: AI is not merely producing texts; it is accelerating the generation and propagation of Dt​-type control surfaces in the human cultural loop.

“Elementary particles are on-going movements that are mutually dependent because ultimately they merge and interpenetrate.” - David Bohm. Wholeness and the Implicate Order - “all is flux”.

Bohm’s claim that thought can become mechanical fits naturally into an inertial VSR account. Retention supplies patterns—habits, categories, conditioned responses—which are replayed as rapid pattern matching: the system generates candidate interpretations and actions by similarity to prior cases and selects among them by learned fit. This mechanical regime is not a defect; it is a powerful compression that enables fast commitment under uncertainty. But it also creates a characteristic failure mode: when pattern matching is treated as direct perception, the loop becomes self-confirming, and the selected “world” is increasingly shaped by inertia rather than by fresh contact with the situation. On this view, intelligence (in Bohm’s sense) is not the elimination of pattern matching but the capacity to notice its limits—i.e., to register incoherence or error and reopen variation so that genuinely new distinctions can enter selection and be retained.

6. Cautious analogies: Bayes and quantum measurement
Many constrained update rules share a “normalize → update” form. The point here is family resemblance, not identity.

6.1 Bayes as constrained reweighting
For hypotheses x and evidence e:

p(x∣e)∝p(e∣x) p(x).

Meaning: prior expectations p(x) are reweighted by how well they predict evidence p(e∣x), then normalized. Retention is “posterior becomes the next prior.”

This matches VSR structurally: a space of possibilities is reweighted under constraint and retained as a new state.

6.2 Quantum measurement as constrained update with a different geometry
For a quantum state ρ and measurement context (POVM) {Ek}, the Born rule gives:

p(k)=Tr(ρEk).

Meaning: the measurement context defines outcome channels k; the state assigns weights; an outcome is realized; then the state updates according to the measurement instrument.

This again resembles “predict / choose / commit,” but the underlying state geometry (complex amplitudes, noncommutativity) differs sharply. The analogy is therefore limited to “constrained update skeleton,” not to substantive equivalence.

(If one wants historical anchors: this two-step structure is classically formalized in the measurement postulates associated with John von Neumann and the probability rule associated with Max Born.)

Both analogies were introduced and examined in the R Rule substack.

Inertial VSR helps them give dual-aspect monism a concrete dynamical realization.

7. Biology and AI: similar loop form, different realizations
7.1 Brains
In brains, St​ spans ongoing activity plus slow-changing synaptic/neuromodulatory organization; Ct is continuous coupling to body and world; U includes plasticity; and λt varies across states (wake, sleep, stress, learning). The “self invariant” Σt is plausibly stabilized by multi-timescale retention.

7.2 Current AI
In many modern deep systems, St​ is weights and optimizer state; Ct​ is data batches, reward, tool feedback; U is gradient-based update. AI systems can generate descriptions Dt​ prolifically, but often those descriptions do not reliably rewrite their own selectors and retention unless the architecture explicitly supports persistent re-entry (chains of conext, self-training, RL, self-modification, memory, long-horizon agency).

So: VSR is an abstraction that makes biology and AI comparable, while leaving room for deep differences in coupling, embodiment, update laws, and the robustness of closure.

Breakout: The importance of Learning from Error
Retention is not merely persistence; it is also error-conditioned learning. In an inertial VSR loop, selection produces commitments that can fail—mis-predict, mis-act, mis-explain—and retention is where those failures are filed as durable constraints: “don’t make that mistake again,” or more generally, “update what counts as plausible and what counts as salient.” This is one route to robustness: error traces reshape future selection so that the system becomes less fragile under perturbation.

But the same mechanism is also a primary engine of creativity: when an error exposes a previously invisible mismatch between model and world, it can open a new region of the possibility space, creating novel distinctions, strategies, or representations that would not have been generated under purely confirmatory selection.

Contemporary LLMs exhibit only a partial analogue. They can register error signals transiently (via self-critique, tool feedback, or external evaluators) and they can avoid mistakes within a session by context conditioning, but—absent explicit persistent update mechanisms such as fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, or long-term memory that genuinely modifies selection bias—the “don’t repeat that mistake” trace often fails to become inertial retention. As a result, their robustness and creativity are frequently episodic: impressive local novelty without the reliable accumulation of error-shaped constraints that characterizes biological learning.

7.3 Other minds
Inertial VSR loops appear at many scales: within organisms (perceptual and motor closures), across developing nervous systems (learning and plasticity), within artificial systems (training and adaptation), and—crucially—across populations where variation and selection multiply in parallel. The proposed view does not assert that every such loop must have an intrinsic “inside,” but it treats that possibility as a reasonable default rather than an absurdity: wherever a loop achieves sustained closure with inertia, individuates a stable boundary of control, and carries forward error-shaped constraints, the conditions for an interior aspect may be present to some degree. This stance is deliberately provisional and requires careful excavation—both conceptually (to avoid trivial panpsychism) and empirically (to avoid empty metaphysics). Still, it is a useful working hypothesis: it keeps our descriptions honest about scale and embodiment, it prevents premature dismissal of intermediate forms of subjectivity, and it foregrounds the question that matters most for the project—namely, which kinds of inertial closure support world-centered disclosure, and which are merely external dynamics with no corresponding interiority.

8. A bridging conjecture with empirical “teeth”
The proposition’s central bridging conjecture is deliberately modest:

Conjecture (Closure-as-disclosure checkpoint): Sustained world-centered disclosure corresponds to a regime of continuous re-closure in which fast commitments are stabilized by slow retention, and slow retention is updated by fast commitments.

This does not claim to derive experience from dynamics. It claims that if disclosure is present, one should expect certain dynamical signatures consistent with inertial closure.

8.1 Risk-exposed expectations (not promises)
If the conjecture is on the right track, then weakening or fragmenting closure should produce characteristic breakdowns in:

temporal thickness (disrupted continuity of the now),

world unity (fragmentation of the field into disconnected arenas),

ownership/mineness (altered self/other boundary),

stability vs plasticity (abnormal effective λt​: either rigidity or runaway updating).

Such breakdown patterns are at least in principle connectable to empirical regimes (sleep transitions, anesthesia, seizure states, dissociation) without assuming any one neuroscience theory. In AI, analogues might include instability of long-horizon coherence, brittle self-consistency under perturbation, or failure to preserve identity-like invariants across contexts when “retention” is weak.

9. Discussion: why this avoids “the filament needs a spark”
A common worry is that any process description still feels like a filament that needs a mysterious “light.” In the present stance, that worry is treated as a category error: it asks for a causal bridge between two things where the proposal is an identity across aspects of one thing. The schema is not offered as a complete explanation of “why experience exists,” but as:

a disciplined description of the process constraints that make selfhood and world-centeredness intelligible, and

a way to talk about how descriptions (including AI-generated ones) re-enter the loop and become part of lived reality.

In short: the goal is not to explain away disclosure, but to describe the minimal process form that any credible explanation must respect.

This resonates with the descriptive emphasis found in phenomenological traditions (including Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger), while retaining a Popperian appetite for conjectures that can be stressed by contact with breakdown modes and system dynamics.

10. Figure: diagram of the schema
Figure 1 depicts the central idea: one underlying inertial VSR process read under two aspects. Intrinsically (left), it is disclosure and self-invariance; extrinsically (right), it is description/knowledge. Descriptions and self-models re-enter to modulate selection and retention, without becoming a second substance.


Inertial VSR as Dual-Aspect Process (diagram)




11. Conclusion
Inertial VSR provides a compact checkpoint schema for discussing self, world-centeredness, and the automation of description by AI within a dual-aspect monist stance. It keeps formulas minimal while making three claims precise:

Self is the maintained invariant of inertial retention, not an added entity.

Disclosure is the intrinsic aspect of continuous commitment under constraint.

Description is extrinsic knowledge that becomes experientially real when it re-enters and modulates selection and retention.

The schema does not pretend to solve the “hard problem” by derivation. It instead clarifies what any serious account must preserve: a continuously re-achieved closure that binds a stable “someone” to a coherent “world,” while allowing descriptions—now increasingly AI-generated—to reshape the very selectors by which worlds are lived.

An (opening and) closing Proposition (Zip of thoughts and things):
World-centered experience is maintained by a zip-like process (or motion) in which closure commits to a working distinction between thoughts and things that structures variation (what alternatives are even available) for the sake of selection, while disclosure presents—and retention stabilizes—that same commitment as a single, world-involving unity.




The “zip” is really a double zipper(*): it opens ahead as possibility (variation) and closes behind as commitment (selection → retention).




I hope this checkpoint is interesting and useful,

Conceptual influences include phenomenology (Husserl/Heidegger), process metaphysics, cybernetics, and “strange loop” intuitions (e.g., Douglas Hofstadter), with cautionary analogies to probabilistic updating and quantum measurement.

"Nature is visible Spirit; Spirit is invisible Nature." ― Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. 1797, Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature

* The “double-zip” can be treated as a mnemonic for two asymmetries already present in our formalism. The leading edge of experience opens a forward horizon of possibilities (variation), while the trailing edge closes by commitment and retention. This temporal asymmetry aligns naturally with the functional A/N split in the R-rule: an A-path that generates and propagates anticipatory structure (an encoding of what could be), and an N-path that constrains, vetoes, or reweights that structure through error/normative pressure (a decoding against what is). The intent is not to identify these as the same mechanism, but to note a stable correspondence: opening corresponds to generative prediction, closing corresponds to constraint-driven stabilization. Used this way, the metaphor helps keep track of how a world can be simultaneously prospective and retrospective without implying a literal zipper in the head. Though I think my late ‘70 teenage self would have given the zip metaphor an appreciative sneer.
