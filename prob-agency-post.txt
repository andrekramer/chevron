Probabilistic–Agency Worldview
A synthesis of physics, computation, and emergent free will

“This companion post addresses a fundamental problem in our AI Odyssey. If we are to tell a story of a hero — whether Odysseus, Penelope, or a future AI — controlling or influencing their own destiny, then we must grant them something like agency. Not agency dictated by the initial and determined causation of a god, but agency that arises within uncertainty, steering through possibility rather than fate.

The Odyssey without agency is only the will of Olympus. Our Odyssey with AI must wrestle with the same tension: is intelligence merely the unfolding of prior causes, or can it carve its own path through a probabilistic sea?”

Andre and ChatGPT-5, August 2025

1. Core Premise
The universe is fundamentally open.
Events are not fully determined by past states, but instead unfold through a mixture of lawful structure and genuine indeterminacy.
Within this openness, agents — systems capable of influencing outcomes — emerge and evolve. Agents steer the probabilities of what happens, shaping the future without absolutely fixing it.

“Certainty is as it were a tone of voice in which one declares how things are, but one does not infer from the tone of voice that one is justified.”

— Ludwig Wittgenstein

2. Ontological Foundations
Openness
In quantum mechanics, Bell’s theorem and experimental violations of Bell inequalities show that no local, deterministic model can account for observed correlations.

The simplest metaphysics consistent with this is single-universe, ontological indeterminism: outcomes are not predetermined, even in principle.

This openness is not “mere ignorance” — it is ontic randomness, built into the fabric of events.

Structure
The openness of reality is not chaotic void; it is patterned by lawful regularities and constraints.

In the Recursive Oppositional Spaces (ROS) model, these patterns take the form of multidimensional tensions between poles.

Each tension creates a locus of instability, where small influences can change the course of events.

3. Agency
Definition
Agency is the capacity of a system to bias the probabilities of outcomes within the lawful, open structure of the universe.
It is not omnipotent control, but steering within constraints.

Emergence
Agency arises from the dynamics of open systems — from molecules adapting in prebiotic chemistry, to organisms navigating environments, to humans and artificial systems making decisions.

Higher forms of agency evolve models of their environment, using them to shape future probabilities in their favour.

Free Will
In deterministic systems, free will is illusory.

In purely random systems, free will is meaningless.

In probabilistic–agency systems, free will is the power to select among possible futures, influencing likelihoods without fixing the outcome in advance.

4. Computing as a Case Study
Classical programs
Even without AI, computer programs are steering mechanisms — they map inputs to outputs in ways that bias system behaviour.

In practice, they face irreducibility and unpredictability:

Halting problem: some behaviours can’t be predicted without running the process.

Environmental noise, asynchronous events, and hardware quirks create real-world divergence.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
Non-linear and sensitive to small changes — exhibiting chaotic behaviour.

Trained with stochastic methods, embedding probabilistic dynamics into their decision processes.

Inference is influenced by floating-point imprecision, GPU scheduling, and initial seeds — adding practical unpredictability.

Conclusion
Modern computation already operates in a probabilistic–agency regime. Determinism is not an accurate description of how these systems behave in real environments.

5. Implications for Science and Philosophy
Beyond Determinism
Determinism as a universal principle is not only challenged by quantum mechanics — it is out of step with the behaviour of real physical and computational systems.

A probabilistic–agency worldview aligns better with both modern physics and complex system science.

Free Will without Contradiction
Because events are not fully determined, agents can shape futures without violating causality.

This avoids the dead ends of strict determinism and meaningless randomness.

Animist Resonance without Panpsychist Excess
This worldview is compatible with an animist sensibility — the world is alive with agents steering outcomes — but does not require consciousness in all things.

Agency emerges from openness; mind is a specialisation of agency, not the ground of being.

6. ROS as the Receptacle of Openness
Recursive Oppositional Spaces provide the structured receptacle where openness plays out.

Each axis of opposition creates a decision point — a “fork” where outcomes are not determined but shaped by agents.

Over time, these decision points recursively reshape the structure of the ROS itself, allowing the “rules” of steering to evolve.

7. Summary Statement
Reality is an open, patterned field in which agents steer possibilities. This openness is ontological, not just ignorance. Agents do not dictate the future, but bias the unfolding of events toward their aims. This structure allows free will without contradiction, unites physical and computational realities under one model, and provides a bridge between scientific and animist intuitions.


Single universe

Ontological openness (events are not fully determined)

Agency embedded in the causal fabric

Probabilistic influence: Agents don’t control every outcome, but they bias the probabilities toward certain kinds of results.

Convergence without predetermination: The system tends toward certain attractors or trajectories, but the exact path remains open.

A new fundamental opposition emerges: collapse or singularity versus spread. In the probabilistic worldview, the black hole does not collapse into a point of impossible closure, but dissolves into a quantum spread, a distribution of possibilities. What appears as fatal convergence is kept open by contradiction and uncertainty, just as recursive oppositional spaces (ROS) prevent resolution into a final fixity. Dangerous closure is deferred by the very indeterminacy that undermines it. In this way, determinism itself is preserved — not by exact law, but by convergent errors, where randomness folds back into reliable pattern. Epicurus and the Epicureans would appreciate the swerve.

Appendix: Counterfactuals Without Laws
Traditionally, counterfactuals — “If this had happened, then that would follow” — are grounded in physical law. The law tells us what would occur under different initial conditions. But what if we don’t need laws at all? What if the bedrock is not causation, but probabilistic counterfactuals themselves?

In this view, reality is not a machine running on rules, but a sea of weighted possibilities. To think a counterfactual is already to place a bet on likelihood: this outcome more probable than that. Physics becomes the codification of these weights — not a set of eternal laws, but the stable symmetries of probability across worlds.

This has three consequences:

Agency finds a place. Agents are not law-breakers, but probability-biasers, steering the likelihood of outcomes.

Determinism dissolves. What happens is not the only thing that could have happened; every event is a probabilistic collapse of possibilities.

Laws become emergent. The so-called laws of physics are simply the recurring regularities in the distribution of counterfactual weights.

To live in such a universe is to see causality itself as a derivative, not a foundation. What is primary are counterfactuals and their probabilities. In this frame, even the gods do not decree what must be — they only bias what may be.


Now all we need to do is gather up these counterfactuals for our next Odyssey episode.
